					<h2 id="AboutMe">About Me</h2>
				</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>I am a Software Developer with most of my experience in Game Development. I have the most experience in Physics and Artificial Intelligence programming. My strongest language is C++, and I've also worked with C, JavaScript, C#, Lua, and HTML.</p>
					<p>I like doing on projects on my own, but I enjoy programming most when I'm on a team of people working towards a common goal. Writing code that contributes to a larger system and seeing it merge with the contributions of others is some of the most satisfying times in development to me.</p>
					<p>When I'm not programming, I'm probably hiking, tending to my ever-growing garden, playing games, making tools for D&D, or excitedly researching a subject completely irrelevant to me, like beekeeping or glassblowing.</p>
					<p>Please say hello if you're interested in hearing anything more!</p>

						<h3>Neural Network - In Progress</h3>
						<p>In December of 2017, I wrote a basic but functional Neural Network. I learned more in-depth about how they work, and with a bit more polishing will have a self-made generalized neural network "library" available for future projects. I still need to add a good method of serialization and the ability to "evolve" multiple networks together to solve problems that backpropogation alone reasonably cannot.</p>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<div id="BehaviorStack">
						<h3>Behavior System - Heavily In Progress</h3>
						<p>The main idea is to use a stack that maintains and manages behaviors. The bottom element in the stack is the default behavior, and whenever interesting things happen that would cause a new behavior, that behavior is pushed to the top of the stack. When that behavior is finished, it pops, and the default behavior is resumed.</p>
					</div>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<div id="Ninsara">
						<h3>Ninsara</h3>
						<p>Ninsara is a D&D world which I'm working on. I am taking things out of the handbook I don't like and expanding on features I think there should be more detail on. I have documents in various states of completion that document towns, royal families, thieves guilds, magic items, and maps of the world. I'm almost done with an automatic character sheet that fills in details after picking race and class that makes the barrier for entry a lot lower.</p>
					</div>
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td>
					<div id="Puzzles">
						<h3>Puzzles</h3>
						<p>I love puzzles, especially puzzle boxes. I enjoy designing and coming up with designs for them in my head, and I've designed a CAD for one puzzle box that I'm particularly happy with.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="Website">
						<h3>My Website</h3>
						<p>This website and the style for it is hand-written by me. It's something that I wanted to do myself, and I learned a lot about HTML and CSS along the way.</p>
