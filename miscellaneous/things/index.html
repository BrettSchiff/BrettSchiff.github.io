						<h3>Utopia</h3>
						<p>Main Idea: Can there be a 'perfect' civilization?</p>
						<p>Conclusion: Normally I would be uncomfortable making any claim involving an entirely subjective work like 'perfect,' but I think it's fair to say that a 'perfect' society is impossible by almost any possible metric you could use to define 'perfect.'</p>
						<p>For the sake of my thoughts here, I will be measuring 'perfect' by equality of the people and overall happiness with and within the society. However, these same arguments will break most Utopias judged by other measures of perfection.</p>
						<p>Since humans are not perfect, they cannot compose a society that <i>is</i> perfect. The main problem with any conceptual understanding or idea of someone's personal Utopia is that in reality it would break down because of the differences between people. To solve disagreements, there must be some sort of code of conduct, or set of laws, or other form of organization that keeps people from coming to their own wildly varying conclusions about what is moral. Without a solid boundary for morals, there is nothing that stops some of the population from being slighted by others.</p>
						<p>While I can't prove that disagreements over morality are inevitable, I think it flows logically that since all humans are not identical to one another, our thoughts and opinions will almost certainly not be identical to one another. Even in cases where everyone has the same end-goal, people often disagree on what exactly is the best way to get there. How much short-term suffering is worth long term happiness? Is it fair to impose short-term suffering on those who will not benefit from the long-term goals? Or even on those who <i>will</i> benefit from those long-term goals? </p>
						<p>If you believe me when I say that people will always disagree with each other and that in a functional Utopia must have a single set of morals that everyone believes in to prevent inequality and discontent, then we are left with two options: 1. The single morality is broken, people are treated unequally and will feel slighted, thus breaking Utopia, or 2. The single morality is imposed upon <i>everyone</i>, even those who disagree, so those people feel unequally represented and therefore slighted, thus breaking Utopia.</p>
